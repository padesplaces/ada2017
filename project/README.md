# Abstract
A 150 word description of the project idea, goals, dataset used. What story you would like to tell and why? What's the motivation behind your project?

# Research questions 

- Do artists tend to cover other artists from the same country ? Same ethnia ? Or different ones ?
- How did those tendencies evolve over time ? For example the racial issues of the middle of the century.
- As our world became more connected over time, do songs spread further than before ?
- Are covers generally more popular than their original ?
- Are older songs more covered than recent ones ?
- Is there a certain genre(s) more covered than other genres ?
- Do artists tend to cover songs from other genres than theirs ?

# Dataset

We will use the Million Songs dataset : 
- mainly the SecondHandSongs dataset to gather all the covers 
- Echo Nest Taste Profile to measure the popularity 
- Last.fm to compute the similarity
- Tagtrum to gather the songs genre 

We will also use Wikipedia to get more informations on the artists (e.g. country of origin).

We might use Amazon for reviews of albums and maybe Spotify for more accurate stats (number of plays, etc).
In addition, thisismyjam could be helpful to complete Echo Nest.
