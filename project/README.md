# **_"My Way"_ of seeing music covers**

### Abstract

Everybody knows the definition of a cover song (and  can cite several of them) as a new performance of a previously recorded song, by someone other than the original artist or composer.
Something that is quite unknown is how the concept of cover version started. Actually, this phenomena started in the 1950s when record companies tried to reach out to more people by a way of reproducing original songs such that those were more appealing to a particular demography. If we go back to the racial segregation period in the United States, there were black radio stations and white radio stations. Covers versions were recorded by White artists and then diffused on white radio stations, without acknowledgement or financial compensation for the original (black) artists and it was clearly a "racist tool" as said the singer-songwriter Don McLean.

Fortunately, the mentality changed and cover versions are nowadays used as a revival of old songs, sometimes with a radically different style, in a different language or with lyrics added for the case of instrumental compositions.
Even if it's becomes a very profitable business for music industry, the goal of a cover version is still to spread a part of musical history to younger generations or to other cultures around the world.


Through a spatial and time analysis of cover songs history, our goal is to explore cultural or social underlying patterns and how it is diffused in a globalized world.

### Research questions 

- Do artists tend to cover other artists from the same country ? Same ethnia ? Or different ones ?
- How did those tendencies evolve over time ? For example the racial issues of the middle of the century.
- As our world became more connected over time, do songs spread further than before ?
- Are covers generally more popular than their original ?
- Are older songs more covered than recent ones ?
- Is there a certain genre(s) more covered than other genres ?
- Do artists tend to cover songs from other genres than theirs ?

### Dataset

We will use the [Million Songs](https://labrosa.ee.columbia.edu/millionsong/) dataset : 

- mainly the [SecondHandSongs](https://labrosa.ee.columbia.edu/millionsong/secondhand) dataset to gather all the covers 
- [Echo Nest Taste Profile](https://labrosa.ee.columbia.edu/millionsong/tasteprofile) to measure the popularity 
- [Last.fm](https://labrosa.ee.columbia.edu/millionsong/lastfm) to compute the similarity
- [Tagtrum](http://www.tagtraum.com/msd_genre_datasets.html) to gather the songs genre 

We will also use Wikipedia to get more informations on the artists (e.g. country of origin).

We might use Amazon for reviews of albums and maybe Spotify for more accurate stats (number of plays, etc).
In addition, [thisismyjam](https://labrosa.ee.columbia.edu/millionsong/thisismyjam) could be helpful to complete Echo Nest.
