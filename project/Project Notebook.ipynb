    "\n",
    "4\\. We also noticed that in case of cliques with 2 elements and with one having shsPerf=0, if the other one has an original shsPerf, we couldn't link to the other song present in the clique (and it's generally the original one). Thus, we created a special algorithm **attribute_original()** to adress this issue.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5\\. Some original performance that were found in the SHS website don't appear in the clique. And we can extract all informations in the SHS website so we decided to choose the earlier released song as original in this case. Furthermore, in some cases, several original shsPerf are returned inside one clique. We created an algorithm **find_original_track()** that return a unique shsPerf that is considered as the original track for each clique.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "6\\. There are duplicated shsPerf in our dataset, it means that we've extracted the same informations from the SHS website (*original shsPerf*, *language* and *released year*) for these tracks. We have checked the concerned tracks and it is mostly duplicated tracks (although they have different *trackID* in the Million Song Dataset). Since they will bias our statistics, we decided to remove the duplicated shsPerf, keeping the one with the fewest missing fields.\n",

    "\n",
