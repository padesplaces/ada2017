In the SHS website, the performance id (that is used in the URL to access to the performance page) is available in our cover dataframe (shsPerf).\n",

    "- For invalid SHS performance ID, API request to the search page (e.g. 'https://secondhandsongs.com/search/performance?title=blackbird&performer=beatles'), extract the perf ID with the find_PerfID() and then use the perfInfo() function."

The API request is limited for the Second Hand Songs (SHS) website to 1000 requests per hour. Due to the large number of requests needed (668 to resolve the missing SHS problem and 18196 to find the Language/Year/Original Song), we'll maybe ask to the SHS team an exception to remove this limitation.\n",
