    "1\\. The track year (year) is sometimes different form the released date (date) we've extracted from the SHS website, we will prefer the data information found in the SHS website after some manual verifications.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2\\. We found several cases where language (14%) and/or released year (7%) information were missing or unavailable. Since we have a small dataset, we cannot allowed to delete a lot of tracks so we kept these tracks and handle this issue in the data analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3\\. A total of 1233 tracks (7%) don't have original shsPerf information so we'll need to face this issue in our algorithm to find the original track for each clique.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4\\. We also noticed that in case of cliques with 2 elements and with one having shsPerf=0, if the other one has an original shsPerf, we couldn't link to the other song present in the clique (and it's generally the original one). Thus, we created a special algorithm **attribute_original()** to adress this issue.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5\\. Some original performance that were found in the SHS website don't appear in the clique. And we can extract all informations in the SHS website so we decided to choose the earlier released song as original in this case. Furthermore, in some cases, several original shsPerf are returned inside one clique. We created an algorithm **find_original_track()** that return a unique shsPerf that is considered as the original track for each clique.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "6\\. There are duplicated shsPerf in our dataset, it means that we've extracted the same informations from the SHS website (*original shsPerf*, *language* and *released year*) for these tracks. We have checked the concerned tracks and it is mostly duplicated tracks (although they have different *trackID* in the Million Song Dataset). Since they will bias our statistics, we decided to remove the duplicated shsPerf, keeping the one with the fewest missing fields.\n",
    "The function **duplicate_to_keep()** handles this issue.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "7\\. Same original shsPerf were found in different cliques, and one *original shsPerf* was linking to a track in another clique. After some verifications, we noticed that some cliques needed to be merged. We created a function **merge_cliques()** that handles this issue.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "8\\. In cliques where no original shsPerf is found and where released date for at least one track is present, it is impossible to define an original song. Thus, these cliques need to be removed from our dataset.\n"
